TinyMCE spellchecker plugin
===========================

Browser-side TinyMCE spellchecker plugin (steps numbered BST#):
NOTE:
TinyMCE ver 3.4.4 has the default option for browser-side spellchecker on supported browsers,
but it is not yet supported by this module. It might work on some browsers, but was not tested.
BST1. Instructions TBD.

Server-side TinyMCE spellchecker plugin (steps numbered SST#):
(These instructions explain how to install and enable server-side spellchecker)

SST1. Download, extract and copy spellchecker plugin from
from http://www.tinymce.com/download/download.php
(Once you are on the download page, download "PHP Spellchecker" 2.x which is listed in the "Other components" section)

into
sites/all/libraries/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/
(overwrite files that came with TinyMCE)

After installation it should be found in sites/all/libraries/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/spellchecker/

As a quick check, the following files should be present in the above path:
- editor_plugin.js
- config.php

SST2. Edit sites/all/libraries/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/spellchecker/config.php

Uncomment one of the lines that select which spellchecker to use:

*It comes with defaults using Google spellchecker.

*Other options: TBD

SST3. Visit http://YOURSITE/admin/reports/status, verify that Wysiwyg TinyMCE spellchecker reports "Installed correctly".

SST4. Visit http://YOURSITE/sites/all/libraries/tinymce/jscripts/tiny_mce/plugins/spellchecker/rpc.php,
you should see a string in curly braces {"result":null,...}.
If you don't see the expected {"result":null,...}, you will have to figure out access permissions or other problems with your webserver or ISP.

SST5. Configure one of your WYSIWYG profiles to show TinyMCE spellcheck button

SST6. Verify that TinyMCE shows the new button when you edit a page using your WYSISWYG profile, and this button works.


CKEditor ASpell plugin
======================

Browser-side CKEditor spellchecker plugin (steps numbered BSC#):
NOTE:
CKEditor has the default option for browser-side spellchecker on supported browsers,
but it is not yet supported by this module. It might work on some browsers, but was not tested.
BSC1. Instructions TBD.

Server-side CKEditor spellchecker plugin (steps numbered SSC#):
(These instructions explain how to install and enable server-side spellchecker)

SSC1. Aspell library (http://aspell.net) must be installed and working on the server. Do not proceed until it works.

SSC5. Visit http://YOURSITE/sites/all/libraries/ckeditor/plugins/aspell/spellerpages/server-scripts/spellchecker.php,
you should see an empty page. If you inspect source, it should have "function init_spell() {..." inside the head section.
If you don't see the expected "function init_spell() {", you will have to figure out access permissions or other problems with your webserver or ISP.

SSC6. If you aren't using PHP for server-side script (this is rarely needed), edit aspell/dialogs/aspell.js, locate oSpeller.spellCheckScript and change it as appropriate. Redo step #SSC5 for selected script.
