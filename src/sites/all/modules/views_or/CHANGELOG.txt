
Views Or x.x-x.x, xxxx-xx-xx
----------------------------
by Anselm Heaton: Initial commit of the views_or module.
  This module helps build filters with OR conditions in views.
by Anselm Heaton: Rewrote to use three filters.

  An alternatives block now uses three filters:
  * begin alternatives: starts an alternatives block.
  * next alternative: separates alternatives in block.
  * end alternatives: ends an alternatives block.
  
  This means that it can now handle multiple alternatives blocks, nested
  alternatives blocks, and filters that use more than one where group. Also
  started factoring the calls that modify the query object; hopefully will ask
  the Views maintainer if these can be included (rather than modifying the
  object directly).
by Anselm Heaton: Added support for inner joins.
by Anselm Heaton: Fixed handling of the case where there is no body in an
  alternative.
  Returns fewer error messages when building filters.
by Anselm Heaton: Updated to work with Views 2 RC2.

by Darren Oh: Reorganized code and added CHANGELOG.txt to track changes.
by Darren Oh: Just realized that code reorganization could be done more
  efficiently by putting similar handlers in the same file.
by Darren Oh: Forgot to change filter handler names in
  views_or_views_data_alter().

  indicate that the fields in between should be coalesced.

by Darren Oh: Added translation template.
